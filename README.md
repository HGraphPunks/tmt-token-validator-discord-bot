## Token Validator Bot

Set up a project at https://replit.com/ and then pull this repo into the project. You can then adapt the token values and role names to match your server.

## To DO

Create a nightly job that uses the DB on replit to recheck the account IDs to make sure they still have the token. If they do not the role will be removed from the user.
